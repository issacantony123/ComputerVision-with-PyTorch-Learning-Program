# Daily Tasks
Daily tasks for TinkerHub PyTorch Learning program.

# Guidelines
Use the following steps to participate in the daily tasks.

* Create a folder with your name in the daily tasks sub repo if it doesn't exist.
* Complete each of the task given in the tasks session.
* Push your code to your folder.
* You can use jupyter notebook or .py files for the tasks.

# Tasks

## Task 1
Day 1 was fun! 

## Task 2
### Playing around with tensors
1. Create two numpy arrays of size 5x3 and 3x4. 
2. Convert them into torch tensors.
3. Multiply the two tensors and print the result.

## Task 3
### Create a neural network using pytorch
Create a neural network with the following configurations
1. An input layer.
2. Two hidden layers.
3. An output layer.
4. torch.nn.Sigmoid functions in between hidden layers.

## Task 4
### Tweak the hyperparameters
1. Check out the [cifar10cnn.py](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/ComputerVision-with-PyTorch-Learning-Program/blob/master/resources/cifar10cnn.py).
2. Tweak the values of hyperparameters like number of output channels, kernel size, learning rate..etc
3. Note how the accuracy and loss changed on tweaking those params as a comment in your code.

## Task 5
### Play around with Pytorch Transforms.
1. Load a set of images from the internet (Be kind and empathetic. Don't use explicit contents)
2. You can use library like [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
3. Go to [pytorch transforms documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html) here.
4. Apply various transformations and see the results.
5. You can use Jupyter notebooks!
